OpenShift Behavior Driven Development Demo 
==========================================

Demonstration of how behavior driven development can be applied in a containerized environment


## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate how CI/CD, DevOps and behavior driven development can be executed in a containerized environment. For the purposes of this demonstration, we will be using a rules-based application and seeing how this can be done with an application with externalized business logic.

By combining the power of containerized environments and core DevOps concepts, we are able to control code quality while maintaining a rapid turnaround time to deploying the latest code across the deployed environments.

## Core Technologies Demonstrated

* OpenShift Container Platform
	* Docker
	* Kubernetes (Container orchestration)
* Jenkins
* Red Hat JBoss BRMS
* Cucumber

## Concepts Highlighted

* Cloud Based Architecture
* Platform as a Service
* DevOps
* Continuous Integration
* Continuous Delivery
* Behavior Driven Development
* Specification by Example
